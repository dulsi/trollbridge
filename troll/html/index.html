<h2>About</h2><p>

Troll Bridge is an adventure in the style of the original Legend of Zelda.
The main character is a troll who has escaped from slavery.  By finding
clues and collecting items, the character works to free his people.
<p>

Although the core engine is done, monster AIs and levels are in need of
much work.  The game is currently not very playable.  If you wish to help
out please visit the game design section.<p>
