<hr>

Troll Bridge is currently not really playable.  It's build method also
currently makes assumptions about the system setup.  These will be
improved in future but for the time being felt it was more important
to release the code.  Since this isn't really intended for general use
no binaries are provided.<p>

Problems:<p>

<ul>
<li>Assumes the Identical Software Graphics Library is installed in
/proj/identical.  (Makefiles)
<li>Assumes Troll Bridge is installed in /proj/troll.  (Utilities)
<li>Not currently setup for a multiuser environment.
</ul><p>
