<hr>

Troll Bridge was designed to be customizable from the start.  Under Linux
a shared library stores the monster and item information.  Unfortunately
the DOS port has no similar feature.  Information on compiling modifications
into a DOS binary will be made available in the future.  Levels and sprites
are editable in both versions.  Command line options to load modifications
are not currently implemented.<p>

Please read the license information if you intend to build modifications to
Troll Bridge.<p>
