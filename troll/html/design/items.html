<center><h1>Troll Bridge: Items</h1></center><p>

The following has various monster ideas without much organization.<p>

<b>Amulet of Yurth</b><br>

Legend says it will give a hero the ability to free the land from an
oppresive ruler.  Purpose of the game is to find this.<p>

<b>Axe</b><br>

A powerful weapon to replace the sword.  Possible allow chopping down
trees.<p>

<b>Pick/Shovel/Gautlets of Digging</b><br>

Allows travel through certain sections.<p>

<b>Anhk</b><br>

Already repels undead but the light effect it supposed to have isn't
implemented.  Until a decission of how to implement darkness is made this
will likely remain.<p>

<b>Phoenix Egg</b><br>

Summonds the Phoenix which allows entry into the air palace and labyrinth.
The character places the egg in the nest at the designated locations to
summon the Pheonix.  James Taintor original suggested the nest as where
you could use it.  He also suggested having the egg disappear after use
and have it reborn in the volcano, however, that requires some method of
leaving the dungeons with the egg.  Another possible use of the egg could
be fast transport around the surface world but that is unlikely.<p>

<b>Fire Magic</b><p>

<b>Spider Magic/Web Magic</b><br>

Stops monsters in a web.  Maybe pick up items as well.<p>

<b>Crossbow &amp; Rope</b><br>

Allows the crossing water/holes in some areas.<p>

<b>Dust of Time</b><br>

(Don't know what it does.)<p>

<b>Wand of Wonder</b><br>

Produces random magic effects some good some not.<p>
