<center><h1>Troll Bridge: Levels</h1></center><p>

<b>Surface World</b><p>

Eventually a rough sketch of the world so far will be placed here.  If you
look at the map in the game it should give you some idea.  The light gray
is the mountain range.  To the left of the mountain range is the desert.
The orange dot in the desert notes the location of the pyramid.  The light
green is the forest.  Over to the far bottom left is a dark green square
where the spider tree is planned.  The light blue is a river.  The river
starts as a waterfall in the mountains.  At the mouth of the river is
a swamp denoted by the brown color.  The dark blue is the sea.  An island
rests in the middle of the sea that will contain the labyrinth.  The air
palace is planned for the open area created by the split in the mountains.
As for the rest undecided.  Possible a ghost town.<p>

People need to be stopped from the leaving the edge of the world.  Either
by setting the edges impassible or by making an infinite walk zone.  If
possible the world shoud be setup to make walking off the edge impossible
through logical means but the desert doesn't have any logical bariers.<p>

<b>Pyramid</b><p>

This is the first level and the only one with anything done.  The level is
a pyramid/triangle shape.  In it the character finds the enchanted sword
which allows the sword to fire a blast.  Also found in the dungeon is the
Ankh.  The common enemies include the cimex and skeletal trolls.  A giant
cobra is used as the level boss.  There is currently a room with a gray
troll that is intended to give information about the next dungeon but
he says nothing.<p>

<b>Volcano</b><p>

Possibly the second level.  It is found at the bottom left of the mountain
range.  Fire elementals are logical monsters.  It is intended to be the
location of the phoenix egg.<p>

<b>Spider Tree</b><br>

The spider tree is Matt Sullivan's idea.  Since there was the idea of
possibly getting some sort of web magic this seemed like a good idea.
Basically this would be a huge tree covered in spider webs that the
character would climb up.  Cimex, spiders and weaver spiders would be
found here.  An enraged troll captive named Odis would be a mini-boss.
The final boss being the Spider Queen, Widowmaker.  Here are Matt's
notes:<p>

The Enraged captive will go into a berserk fury when you release him from
the spider's web.  Odis should attack by spinning around and swinging
his sword.  There should be a few weaver spiders in this room (they shoot
stun webs).  When you beat the Captive (Odis) he comes to his senses and
tells about the Spider Queen (Called the Widowmaker by Trollfolk) and gives
you a healing herb before running away.  Incidentally, Odis' animation will
have big red and white swirly, hypnotized eyes.  (Heh heh heh...) This is
not his last appearance.<p>

Widowmaker consists of several graphical blocks with a moving head (sort of
like the multi-headed dragon from Zelda).  She'll shoot webs at you which
stun and cause a little damage while spiders run around the room, bumping
into you.  The best tactic will be to kill all the spiders and then the
queen.  Maybe a few spiders could come out whenever you hit her.<p>

<b>Waterfall</b><br>

The waterfall is home to the octoids.  No ideas really exist beyond this.
This could possibly be kept as a secret that isn't mentioned anywhere.<p>

<b>Labyrinth</b><br>

The labyrinth was suggested by James Taintor.  It would be reached by using
the phoenix egg in the nest to the south of the island where the labyrinth
lies.  The boss would obviously be the minotaur.  After defeating him you
would retrieve the axe.<p>

<b>Air Palace</b><br>

Another area only reachable by the phoenix egg.  Air elementals would
inhabit this level.  The beholders could possible make an apperance or
be the boss of the level.<p>

<b>Ghost Town</b><br>

Ghosts and perhaps other undead as opponents.<p>
