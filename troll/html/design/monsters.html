<hr>

The following has various monster ideas without much organization.<p>

<b>Scorzion</b><br>

<img alt="[Scorpion Image]" height=36 width=47 src="scorpion.gif">

Large two-tailed scorpions live in the desert to the west.  (For inspiration
see <a href="http://azstarnet.com/~sasi/arthnatr/animalrm/pepe.htm">
Pepe, the Two-Tailed Scorpion</a>.)<p>

<b>Beholder</b><br>

<img alt="[Beholder Image]" height=36 width=44 src="beholder.gif">

Beholder-like creature.  (Possibly level boss.)<p>

<b>Ghost</b><br>

<img alt="[Ghost Image]" src="ghost.gif">

Color-shifted troll possibly carrying chains.<p>

<b>Mummy</b><br>

Originally a mummy was planned for the level boss.  Matt Sullivan named
him Apalak Ramtusk I, the mighty ruler of the first great troll empire.
He'll probably be able to throw his wrappings to stun the character and
attack in hand-to-hand.  Unfortunately no one was able to develop a good
picture for a mummy.  Although it probably wouldn't be used for the pyramid
anymore a mummy is still desirable.<p>

<b>Fire Elemental</b><br>

Another creature that no good image could be made.<p>

<b>Toad</b><br>

Some sort of jumping creature was wanted for the mountain area.
Currently a toad is used.  Other possibilities were mountain goats or
a goat-man.  Still need a name for the creature.<p>

<b>Spider</b><br>

One can't have a spider tree without spiders.  Images so far aren't
quite satifying.<p>

<b>Minotaur</b><br>

<img alt="[Partial Minotaur]" src="minotaur.gif">

<img alt="[Ugly Minotaur]" src="minotaur2.gif">

The first image is the beginings of a minotaur.  The second completes the
head but doesn't look good enough and no ideas for animation have occured.
<p>

<b>Turtle</b><br>

<img alt="[Turtle Shell]" src="turtle1.gif">

<img alt="[Ugly Turtle]" src="turtle2.gif">

Here is the initial sketch of a turtle boss for the waterfall area.
<p>

<b>Two-Headed Troll</b><br>

<img alt="[Two-Headed Troll]" src="twoheads.gif">

The two-headed trolls are used as guards by Granak.  They aren't planned
to be encountered but this image was done up one night and perhaps could
be used for an intro or some thing.<p>
