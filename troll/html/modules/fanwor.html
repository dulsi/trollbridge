<b>The Story So Far ...</b><p>

Once there was peace on the world Fanwor. Princess Gemda ruled wisely, she
used the eight Gems of Power to protect the kingdom. But one day while Gemda
was away on holiday, the monsters came and stole the Gems! Without these Gems
anarchy broke out and the monsters ruled over the country. They hid the
stones in eight different dungeons because they were unable to destroy the
Gems.<p>

Gemda now sent out the best heros of the world to get the stones back so
that everybody can live in peace again. You are now one of these heros! Try
your best to collect the stones and if you succeed, honor and wealth will
be yours!<p>
