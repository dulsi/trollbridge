<b>The Story So Far ...</b><p>

Granak invaded your homeland when you were still a child.  Tales are told
of the former prosperity but none of that can be seen today.  Instead you
mine ore and precious metals for the conquerers.  In return you receive
barely enough to survive.  Those who protest are beaten.  Sometimes the
guards even punish someone who has done nothing.<p>

At least that is how it was until three days ago when you killed a guard
who was punishing your sister.  After escaping from the mining camp, you
have run northward.  Hopefully the guards will hunt you instead of blaming
your sister.  Tired and hungry you recently discovered a cave that could
provide a resting place.<p>
