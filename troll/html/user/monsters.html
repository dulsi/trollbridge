<i>Gray Trolls</i> were once numerous and probably the most advanced of the
Troll races but that was before they were nearly destroyed by a plague.  The
disease only affected them but was carried by other races as well.  Today
the remaining Gray Trolls generally live in remote areas.

<img alt="[Merchant]" height=38 width=42 src="merchant.gif" align=left>
<i>Merchants</i> provide supplies to the hunters and adventurers who travel
to this region.  They are generally a rough and rude lot but the shops can
provide useful tools for a price.

<b>Foes</b><p>

<tr><td>
<img alt="[Air Elemental]" height=38 width=46 src="airelemental.gif" align=left>
<i>Air Elementals</i> are powerful spirits of wind.  Projectiles are blown
away by the powerful winds that make up their bodies.  Even direct attacks
by a sword or axe are ineffective without an enchanted edge.

</td></tr><tr><td>
<img alt="[Cimex]" height=22 width=22 src="bug.gif" align=left>
The <i>Cimex</i> is a small bug found throughout the world.  They scurry
around without organization or reason.  They have a variety of coloring
but none are more dangerous than the others.

</td></tr><tr><td>
<img alt="[Giant Cobra]" height=72 width=48 src="cobra.gif" align=left>
The <i>Giant Cobra</i> was once used as guards by the cult of the snake.
The immense serpent has the ability to spit magical fire.  Very few of these
beasts remain today as the cult of snake is no longer as strong as they
once were.

</td></tr><tr><td>
<img alt="[Octoid]" height=38 width=94 src="octoid.gif" align=left>
<i>Octoids</i> are sentient octopuses that can walk upright and use tools.
They aren't as sophisticated technologically as trolls.  Their skin requires
a lot of moisture and therefore they are usually found arounds bodies of
water.

</td></tr><tr><td>
<img alt="[Scorzion]" height=36 width=96 src="scorpion.gif" align=left>
<i>Scorzions</i> are large two-tailed scorpions that live in the desert to
the west.  The red scorzion is slightly faster.

</td></tr><tr><td>
<img alt="[Skeleton]" height=40 width=46 src="skeleton.gif" align=left>
<i>Skeletal Trolls</i> are the animated skeletons of dead trolls.  These
undead creatures are basically mindless but they will attempt to attack
nearby trolls.
