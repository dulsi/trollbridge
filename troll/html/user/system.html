<b>System Requirements</b><p>

<table cols=1>
<tr><td>
<img alt="[Troll and Tux]" src="linux.gif" height=40 width=78 align="left">
The Linux version of Troll Bridge has low system requirements and should
run well on 486/66 or better.  The game can be played from the console
or through X Windows.  The X Windows version currently requires the
shared memory extension and therefore cannot be displayed remotely.
X Windoes is further limited to only running in 8 bits per pixel color
mode.  Although linux supports many architectures, Troll Bridge runs
under the intel 86 architecture.  Optional joystick support is
available.

</td></tr><tr><td>
<img alt="[Troll and DosFish]" src="dos.gif" height=70 width=84 align="left">
The Dos version of Troll Bridge was done very quickly and as such suffers
from performance problems.  It runs well on a 586/200 or better.  DPMI
is used and has been found to work under Windows 95 and NT.

</td></tr><tr><td>
Neither version currently supports sounds.  Graphics are VGA and therefore
should be supported by all graphics cards except for the oldest systems.
