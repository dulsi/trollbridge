When initial starting the game you have the option of creating a new
character or quiting the game.  If there where any created characters
you would be allowed to load them as well.  When the list of characters
cannot fit on one screen an arrow will appear at the bottom right
indicating that there are more names.  The up and down directions
will change the selected option.  Start selects the option.

<b>Creating New Character</b><p>

To create a new character you must enter the character's name.  Names
are limited to eight characters.  The direction pad move the gray
brackets.  The A button adds the character.  The B button deletes the
last character.  Once a suitable name is select simply press start.
<i>Note:</i> If you chose the same name as a saved character, the saved
character will be loaded.  Because of the Dos filesystem under Dos
character names are not case sensitive (i.e "GeoRGe" is the same as
"george").

</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Game Over Options</b><p>

When your character dies you presented with several options.  Continue
allows you to continue the game with whatever items you had acquired.
Save stores your character on disk.  Retry throws out all items you
had acquired and returns to the starting screen.

</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Removing Characters</b><p>

At present Troll Bridge does not have an option for removing characters.
This is planned for the future.  Save files are the character's name plus
the extention "trs".  To work around the problem you can simply delete
the appropriate file from a command line or file manager.
