At the start, your troll has been running from Granak's men.  He has no
equipment.  After three days of travel the cave looks like a good place to
rest.

Within the cave awaits an old gray troll.  Gray trolls are rare and often
avoid other trolls.  He offers you a sword.  "The secrets to your destiny
are buried to the west," repeats the old troll.

Following the advice of the gray troll, you head out into the desert.
After walking some distance and fighting some scorzions, you discover an
immense pyramid.  Ignoring the fear rising within you, you enter the pyramid.

a merchant's shop.  Here you can purchase items to aid you in your
adventure.
