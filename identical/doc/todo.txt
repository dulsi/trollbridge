To Do List

* Currently only Medium, Compact, Large and Huge memory models work (MSDOS)
* IImagePCXLoad() and IImagePCXSave() do not work in Medium memory model
     (MSDOS)
* IImagePCXLoad() and IImagePCXSave() won't function properly on big endian
     machines
* Implement control and alt keys properly and ctrl-alt-del (MSDOS)
* Keypad functions are not implemented (instead of a buffer has a list of
     currently pressed keys including shift, control and alt)
* More examples and documentation
* Installation procedure
* Extend TIM functionality
* Fix MSDOS gcc/allegro port to not do two extra copies of the screen
* Check IKeyBuffer character codes (SDL)

Future...

* Non shared memory version for X Windows
* More geometry fetures (especialy a filled polygon draw)
* Defines for the various key codes returned by IKeybufferGet()
* Joystick and mouse support
* Add assembly version of ILineDraw()
* More image formats (in particular png)
* Multi frame sprites
* Port to Borland/Turbo Pascal
* Port to Windows (very low on list)
* Port to Mac (possibly lower than Windows port)
* C++ Class Library
