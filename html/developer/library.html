<hr>

Information on building your own modification library for Troll Bridge
is currently not available.  The original intent was to include a example
with the program but it was decided to release the game rather than wait
to finish that.  For now your best option is to examine the shared
library for the main game.  Hopefully this missing information can be
added in the near future.<p>
