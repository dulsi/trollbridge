<b>Keyboard Controls</b><p>

Troll Bridge emulates a nintendo controller with the keyboard.  The key
combinations are similar to those used by Nintendo emulators so that
they are familiar to the user.  Eventually the keys are planned to be
configurable but that option is not available at this time.<p>

<b>Joystick Controls</b><p>

Only the Linux version currently supports the joystick and even then only
two buttons are supported.  The first button is B and the second
corresponds to A.  (The original joystick used for testing had a nintendo
controller setup but the "A" button was the second button.)<p>
