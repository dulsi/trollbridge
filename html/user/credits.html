<b>Dennis Payne</b> is a recent graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute.  He currently works for Softscape, Inc on LightYear, a web
based solution framework and event management system.  Game developer
is Dennis's preferred occupation and remains a focus for the future.
While at RPI he worked with two friends to develop Legend of Zelda for
the PC.  Unfortunately the project fell apart but he learned valuable
experience.  He started Troll Bridge to provide a more object oriented
framework with customization through dynamically linked libraries.
