<p><b>Dennis Payne</b> is a graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute.  He currently works for Skillsoft.  Game development has
always interested Dennis. While at RPI he worked with two friends to
develop Legend of Zelda for the PC.  Unfortunately the project fell apart
but he learned valuable experience.  He started Troll Bridge to provide
a more object oriented framework with customization through dynamically
linked libraries. He can be emailed at
