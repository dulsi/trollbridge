Troll Bridge was first developed many years ago. Most systems should be
about to run the game without any problems. It originally supported Linux
and Dos. The Linux had multiple backends. It supported the console, X windows,
and SDL. Only SDL is supported currently. Although the code should be
portable, the file formats are currently architecture dependant.

Windows.
