Troll Bridge is an adventure in the style of the original Legend of Zelda. The
main character is a troll who has escaped from slavery. By finding clues and
collecting items, the character works to free his people.

Although the core engine is done, monster AIs and levels are in need of much
work. The game is currently not very playable.

The code and levels are made available under GPLv2.
